# The restic-backup-fs@.service allows to backup arbitrary locations on the
# host file system.
#
# The unit is templated, which allows is it to be used with separate named
# configs. After installing the unit the following files need to be created
# in the `__PREFIX__/etc/restic-backup-systemd/instances/<instance-name>`
# directory.
#
#    - `env`: containing any environment variables required to configure restic.
#      This file must include the environment variables to configure the restic
#      repository location and the password for it.
#      See: https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/040_backup.html#environment-variables
#
#    - `files`: containing a list of patterns matching files and directories
#      to back up. The file is passed to restic's --files-from option.
#      See: https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/040_backup.html#including-files
