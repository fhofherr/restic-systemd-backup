# restic-systemd-backup

`restic-systemd-backup` is a collection of systemd units and shell
scripts that allow me to backup my systems.

The initial idea for the code contained in this repository came from
[this blog post](https://tdem.in/post/restic-with-systemd/) and [this
github issue](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1015).
